## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
whiteboarding a problem is very new to me, so this challenge for this assignment was to reference the whiteboard template and try to format mine in the same way. Not knowing much about Big O right now or how to calculate it yet, I left that part (and some others that didn't seem applicable to me at the time) out of my whiteboarding for this assignment.

## Solution
This code did not need to be run or tested for the assignment today, it was a whiteboard challenge only.
