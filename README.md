## 401 Data Structures, Code Challenges

# Array-Reverse
Reverse an array without using native .reverse() method.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
whiteboarding a problem is very new to me, so this challenge for this assignment was to reference the whiteboard template and try to format mine in the same way. Not knowing much about Big O right now or how to calculate it yet, I left that part (and some others that didn't seem applicable to me at the time) out of my whiteboarding for this assignment.

## Solution
This code did not need to be run or tested for the assignment today, it was a whiteboard challenge only.

# Array-Insert-Shift
Add a value to the middle on an array without using native JavaScript methods

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
I could not find a solution to this without using a native method so I just used .splice(). Since this is a whiteboarding assignment per the instructions, I used this opportunity to practice my whiteboarding skills rather than wracking my brain trying to re-write .splice(). I will update this after code review tomorrow, when I will hopefully know how to complete the actual challenge.

## Solution
This code did not need to be run or tested for the assignment today, it was a whiteboard challenge only.

# Binary-Search
Add a value to the middle on an array without using native JavaScript methods

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
Read about binary search in the documentation provided by the code challenge, and did my best to implement when I leared.

## Solution
This code did not need to be run or tested for the assignment today, it was a whiteboard challenge only.

# Technical Interview
I worked with Nate to perform a mock interview. I completed a challenge that took in a given matrix and then found the sum of each array in the matrix, returning the in a new array. Nate took on a challenge to find the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence and return the value of it.

## Approach & Efficiency
Nate and I helped each other out with the challenges, though I think he was a better help to me than I was to him. It really helped for me to be able to talk through my thought process with someone.

## Solution
This code did not need to be run or tested for the assignment today, it was a whiteboard challenge only. Nate and I think that the solution for the fibonacci sequence problem will likely not work, but we were unable to figure out a working solution.
